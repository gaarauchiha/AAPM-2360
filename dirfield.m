%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Plot direction field for the first order ODE y' = f(t,y)
%   IndVarVals - vector of grid points of the independent variable
%   DepVarVals - vector of grid points of the dependent variable
%   f is an anonymous (@) function or name of an m-file in single quotes
%   SegmentLength - length of tick marks
%
% Usage example: y' = -y^2 + t
%   show direction field for t in [-1,3], y in [-2,2]
%   using a spacing of .2 for both t and y:
%
%   f = @(t,y) -y^2+t
